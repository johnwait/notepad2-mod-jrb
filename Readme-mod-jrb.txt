* File-change notifications received while in the background being deferred
  until window is shown again

Notes:
* If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for the implemented
  lexers (and not only) feel free to provide patches/pull requests.
  Without patches or pull requests chances are that nothing will be
  fixed/implemented.
* No new features are expected to be added. You prefer new toys? Then
  have a look at Notepad3 (https://github.com/rizonesoft/Notepad3) or
  consider switching to a modern code editor like Atom (https://atom.io)
  or Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com).
* This fork is not expected to be localized either.
