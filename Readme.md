## Notes:

* If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for the implemented lexers (and **not** only)
  feel free to **provide patches/pull requests**. Without patches or pull requests chances are
  that nothing will be fixed/implemented.
* No new features are expected to be added. You prefer new toys? Then have a look at
  **[Notepad3](https://github.com/rizonesoft/Notepad3)** or consider switching to a modern
  code editor like **[Atom](https://atom.io)** or **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)**.
* This fork is not expected to be **localized** either.
